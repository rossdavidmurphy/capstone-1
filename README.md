## ðŸ§  Interesting Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s an example of how transactions are saved to a CSV file and stored in memory at the same time:

```java
public static void makeADeposit() {
    ...
    LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
    LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();

    try {
        BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("data/transactions.csv", true));
        String ledgerEntryAsString = String.format("%tF | %tT | %s | %s | %.2f", date, time, description, vendor, amount);

        LedgerEntry ledgerEntry = new LedgerEntry(date, time, description, vendor, amount);
        ledgerEntries.add(ledgerEntry);
        bufferedWriter.write(ledgerEntryAsString);
        bufferedWriter.newLine();
        bufferedWriter.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Error writing to transactions.csv file");
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
